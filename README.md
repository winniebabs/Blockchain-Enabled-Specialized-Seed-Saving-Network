# Blockchain-Enabled Specialized Seed Saving Network

## Overview

The Blockchain-Enabled Specialized Seed Saving Network is a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to preserve agricultural biodiversity through careful tracking and management of locally adapted crop varieties. By creating a transparent, immutable record of seed information, we enable farmers, gardeners, and seed savers to maintain high-quality seed stock while preserving genetic diversity.

## Core Features

Our network consists of four primary smart contract systems:

### 1. Variety Registration Contract
- Records comprehensive details of locally adapted crop varieties
- Documents origin, history, and unique characteristics
- Creates a permanent, verifiable record of variety provenance
- Establishes ownership and stewardship rights
- Enables seed exchange tracking

### 2. Growing Condition Contract
- Tracks optimal climate parameters for each variety
- Records specific soil requirement data
- Documents successful growing regions
- Links environmental data to seed performance
- Helps match varieties to suitable growing locations

### 3. Isolation Tracking Contract
- Manages minimum distance requirements between related crops
- Prevents unwanted cross-pollination
- Maintains variety purity
- Creates visual mapping of planting areas
- Alerts users to potential cross-pollination risks

### 4. Germination Testing Contract
- Monitors seed viability over time
- Records germination test results
- Tracks seed storage conditions
- Predicts seed viability lifespans
- Recommends optimal testing schedules

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Basic understanding of blockchain transactions
- Seed variety information
- Access to growing condition data

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-seed-network.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure your Ethereum wallet connection
4. Run the setup script:
   ```
   npm run setup
   ```

## Usage

### Registering a Seed Variety
1. Navigate to the Variety Registration interface
2. Complete all required fields about your seed variety
3. Submit transaction through your connected wallet
4. Receive your unique variety identifier

### Recording Growing Conditions
1. Select your registered variety
2. Enter soil composition, pH, temperature range, water requirements
3. Add regional success information
4. Submit data to blockchain

### Setting Up Isolation Tracking
1. Enter field/garden GPS coordinates
2. Select varieties being grown
3. View isolation recommendations
4. Confirm planting locations

### Performing Germination Tests
1. Select seed batch to test
2. Record test date, conditions, and methodology
3. Enter germination results
4. View historical germination data and projections

## Technical Architecture

The network operates on the Ethereum blockchain with four primary smart contracts:

- `VarietyRegistry.sol`: Manages variety registration and related metadata
- `GrowingConditions.sol`: Handles environmental and cultivation requirements
- `IsolationManager.sol`: Calculates and enforces isolation distances
- `GerminationTracker.sol`: Records and analyzes seed viability data

All contracts are interconnected through a shared data model that maintains relationships between varieties, growing conditions, locations, and viability metrics.

## Data Privacy

While blockchain transactions are public, our system implements optional privacy measures:
- Location data generalization
- Encrypted variety details with selective disclosure
- Private germination test results with public attestations

## Community & Governance

Our network is governed by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization):
- Voting rights for protocol upgrades
- Community-driven standard setting
- Grants for rare variety preservation
- Collective decision-making on platform evolution

## Future Development

Planned enhancements include:
- Mobile app for field data collection
- IoT integration for automated condition monitoring
- AI prediction models for optimal growing practices
- Integration with traditional seed bank databases
- Climate change adaptation tracking
